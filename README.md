## Special Item Sound Restoration

This is a gecko code that makes the game play a different sound effect (Mario Kart DS' special item sound) if the item's ID is out of a certain range.

Mario Kart Wii was the first game in the series to excise the special item sound effect after being used for two games. This mod restores the sound effect using the sound ripped and adjusted from Mario Kart 7 and applies it to all new items (except Thundercloud) and the returning items from Mario Kart DS. The following items are affected by this mod.

* 	Lightning/Shock
* 	Star
* 	Golden/Dash Mushroom
* 	Mega Mushroom
* 	Blooper
* 	POW Block
* 	Bullet Bill
* 	Triple Sets (except Triple Mushrooms)

If you want to change the sound or fix bugs, all expanded resources are in the following locations in "revo_kart."

	Bank Index: 738 "GRP/RACE"
	Sequence Index: 739 "GRP/RACE"
	Sound ID: 1EA in "EXP/SE/RC/ITEM/DECIDE/SPECIAL"
	Bank: "RACE/UI/SP"
	Group: "RACE"
